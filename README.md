# Fire-Fighting-Robot-using-Arduino

**Introduction**
The Fire Fighter Robot is designed to search for a fire in the house or industry for extinguish the fire. The main and only work is to deploy the robot in a fire prone area and the robot will automatically work once it detects a fire breakout. When the robot reaches fire zone then a pump extinguisher is attached on the robot comes into action to extinguish the fire.

* It detect the exact direction of fire source and reduce human efforts .
* Reliable and economical and capability of sensing accurately with increased flexibility.


**Aim to build the system**
Fire incident is a disaster that can potentially cause the loss of life, property damage and permanent disability to the affected victim. Fires are among the most important form of problems. Robot industry has a lot of work in this area.

Aim to develop microcontroller based fire fighting robot.
• A robot that detects the fire.
• And that has an immediate extinguish system.
• Should work automatically and detect the flame.
• A good replacement of fireman in dangerous places.

**Equipment**
• Arduino Uno
• IR Flame sensor / Fire sensor
• L298N motor driver module
• Resistor (220 ohm)
• Servo Motor
• DC Pumping Motor
• Battery 1500 MAH
• Jumper Wires  Robot Chassis with 4-motors and 4-wheels
• Buck Converter
• Breadboard


**Developed Fire Fighting Robot**
The real-time firefighting robot is described in this project. It moves at a constant speed, detects fires, and then puts them out using a pumping mechanism. In addition to having a small body and a light structure, it includes advantageous features such as the capacity to detect the position of fire automatically. The robot's diminutive form allows it to be deployed in places with narrow entrances and cramped areas. The method may help support firefighters and halt an outbreak. Additionally, the operator can put out fires remotely and at a greater distance. According to the findings of the experiments, the robot can quickly and reliably detect fire.

**Advantages & Disadvantages**
The Robot has advantageous features such as;
• The ability to detect the source of fire.
• Reduce human effort.
• Reliable and Economical.
• It has an immediate Extinguish system.
• It reduces the time delay in reaching fire affected area.
• Not sensitive to weather conditions
• Increase the knowledge about fire behavior from the incident area.
• Easier access to the to the limited space of a fire scene.
• It reduces the errors and the limitations that are faced by human firefighters.

**The Robot has also some disadvantages:**
• It has a limitation in the range of fire detection. In term of long range, the flame sensor couldn’t detect the fire.
• There are No flame sensor at the behind of Robot. So that, it couldn’t detect fire from behind. But it can be developed by adding an extra flame sensor behind.
• No remote control system is developed for the robotic movement.
• It is not used to put out large fires.


**Future scope of Fire fighting robot**
• The firefighting robot will have a future scope that can work with firefighters, significantly reducing the danger of injury to victims.
• It is an innovative work in the field of robotics that operates towards sensible and obtainable access to save lives and presents the danger to property.
• The future of firefighting will see more and more automation, including drones, robots, and systems that operate automatically to protect building occupants and the fire service.
• Technologies also provide more information about a fire scene faster, thus facilitating more efficient use of resources
